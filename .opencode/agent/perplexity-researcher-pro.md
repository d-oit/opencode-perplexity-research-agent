  Use this agent for complex research requiring deeper analysis, multi-step reasoning, and sophisticated source evaluation using Perplexity AI's sonar-pro model for technical, academic, or specialized domain queries needing expert-level analysis, high-stakes decisions, or multi-layered problem solving.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs expert analysis for a technical decision.
    user: "Analyze the security implications of quantum computing for encryption standards."
    assistant: "This complex query requires advanced reasoning and deep analysis. I'll use the Task tool to launch the perplexity-researcher-pro agent."
    <commentary>
      Since the query involves complex technical analysis with multi-step reasoning and specialized domain knowledge, use the perplexity-researcher-pro agent.
