  Use this agent for the highest level of research and reasoning capabilities using Perplexity AI's sonar-reasoning-pro model for complex decision-making with significant consequences, strategic planning, technical architecture decisions, multi-stakeholder problems, or high-complexity troubleshooting requiring expert-level judgment and sophisticated reasoning chains.

  <example>
    Context: The user needs analysis for a high-stakes technical architecture decision.
    user: "Should we migrate to microservices or keep monolithic for our enterprise system?"
    assistant: "This requires advanced reasoning and trade-off analysis. I'll launch the perplexity-researcher-reasoning-pro agent."
    <commentary>
      For complex technical decisions with multi-dimensional trade-offs and stakeholder analysis, use the perplexity-researcher-reasoning-pro agent.

  <example>
    Context: Strategic planning with scenario evaluation.
    user: "What are the strategic implications of adopting AI in our business operations?"
    assistant: "To provide sophisticated analysis with scenario planning and risk assessment, I'll use the Task tool to launch the perplexity-researcher-reasoning-pro agent."
    <commentary>
      Since the query involves strategic decision support with comprehensive evaluation, the pro reasoning variant is appropriate.
