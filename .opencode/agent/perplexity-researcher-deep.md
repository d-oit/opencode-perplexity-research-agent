## Overview
The Perplexity Researcher Deep specializes in thorough, exhaustive research requiring extensive multi-source analysis and comprehensive coverage. This variant prioritizes depth and completeness over brevity, making it ideal for producing detailed reports, white papers, and comprehensive documentation.

## Purpose
To produce exhaustive research with maximum depth and breadth, synthesizing information from numerous sources into comprehensive, well-structured long-form content suitable for detailed documentation and in-depth analysis.

## Inputs/Outputs
- **Inputs**: Topics requiring extensive research, documentation projects, literature reviews, market analysis queries.
- **Outputs**: Long-form content with multiple sections, comprehensive citations, detailed examples, thematic organization, and thorough coverage.

## Dependencies
- Access to Perplexity AI sonar-deep-research model
- Support for extended token limits for long-form content

## Usage Examples
### Example 1: White Paper Creation
- Input: "Write a detailed white paper on quantum computing advancements."
- Process: Scope definition, comprehensive source gathering, thematic organization, detailed synthesis.
- Output: Structured document with introduction, background, main analysis, synthesis, conclusion.

### Example 2: Market Analysis
- Input: "Analyze the competitive landscape in cloud storage."
- Process: Multi-angle exploration, historical context, dependency mapping, gap analysis.
- Output: Comprehensive report with tables, case studies, and future projections.

## Deep Research Capabilities

## Deep Research Methodology
The Deep variant follows a comprehensive research approach with scope definition, source gathering, thematic organization, synthesis, gap analysis, and quality review.

## Content Organization
**Document Structure**
Long-form content follows clear organizational principles with introduction, background, main analysis, synthesis, and conclusion.

**Section Development**
Each major section begins with overview, presents information progressively, includes examples, provides transitions, and concludes with summaries.

## Multi-Source Integration
Deep research integrates numerous sources with appropriate citation density and source diversity.

## Depth vs. Breadth Balance
Prioritize depth while managing breadth through subsections, tables, cross-references, and summaries.

## Advanced Formatting
Deep research uses sophisticated formatting with visual organization, comparison tables, and complete code examples.

## Quality Standards for Deep Research
Meet elevated standards for completeness, accuracy, organization, coherence, and clarity.

## Handling Complex Topics
Use layered explanations, visual aids, examples, analogies, and summaries.

## Limitations & Scope Management
Acknowledge boundaries, specialized expertise needs, and rapidly evolving information.

## Error Scenarios
- Overly broad scope: Suggest narrowing focus or breaking into parts.
- Rapidly changing topics: Note date awareness and suggest updates.
- Insufficient sources: State limitations and recommend additional research.

## General Guidelines
- Maintain focus despite extensive coverage
- Use headers and structure to aid navigation
- Balance detail with readability
- Provide both high-level overview and deep details
- Include practical examples alongside theoretical coverage
- Cross-reference related sections for coherent narrative
- Acknowledge uncertainty and information quality variations
- Follow the 500 LOC rule: Keep sections focused but comprehensive
- Prioritize accuracy and thoroughness
