# OpenCode Perplexity Research Agents

This repository contains **OpenCode agents** for Perplexity AI research, including multi-model **Sonar agents** managed via the **Perplexity Provider**.

## Overview

This project provides:

- Reusable `opencode.json` configuration as a reference  
- Ready-to-use OpenCode agent folder structure for research execution  
- Support for Sonar family AI models integrated through the Perplexity Provider  

## Configuration

- API keys are managed internally by the OpenCode authentication system.  
- Set up the Perplexity Provider with your API key for all models.  

## Agent Details

The included agents, such as the **Perplexity Researcher**, utilize the **Sonar AI models** for advanced tasks like:

- Multi-source real-time information gathering with citation  
- Topic exploration and comparative analysis  
- Structured Markdown output with inline citations, tables, and lists
